# Decision Tree Analysis in Persian

This project explores the concepts and applications of decision trees in machine learning, with explanations and implementation entirely in Persian. It is a valuable resource for Persian-speaking data science enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Conceptual Explanation**: Detailed description of decision tree algorithms and their applications.  
- **Practical Implementation**: Step-by-step code in Python.  
- **Visualization**: Creating and interpreting decision tree plots.  

## Tools and Libraries
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and explanations.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing decision tree algorithms.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data and trees.  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Decision_Tree_Analysis_Persian.git
   ```  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook decision_tree_analysis_persian.ipynb
   ```  
3. Follow the Persian instructions inside the notebook to understand and execute the analysis.  

## About
This project was created to demonstrate decision tree analysis and make machine learning concepts accessible to Persian-speaking audiences.
